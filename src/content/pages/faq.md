  - q: What should I wear?
    a: "Something versatile and comfortable. Rule of thumb: you never know what the
      weather will be like. For our Highlights Tour, you will not
      be getting off the bus, except at possibly one or two stops to stretch."

  - q: Why should I buy my tickets online?
    a: Buying online is the most convenient way to get your tickets. You can save

      information will be safe.

      policies apply: We recommend making a reservation in advance and
      confirming it at least 24 hours in advance. Please give us at least 4 hours from the time of your call to get back to you, since sometimes we are on custom tours or other tasks and cannot return your call immediately."
  - q: Will I receive a confirmation message after completing an online booking?

      from Mid Mo Tours, confirming your booking and the details of your
      tour(s), and one from our secure payment provider. This serves as proof of
      payment. Both emails should arrive within a few minutes of completing your
      reservation. "
