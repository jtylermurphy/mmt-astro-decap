        Mid Mo Tours Cancellation & Rescheduling Policy requires that cancellations must be requested at least 24 hours
        before your scheduled tour start time (Central Time) to receive a refund; cancellations made within 24 hours are
        not refundable. You may reschedule to an alternate available date by contacting us at least 6 hours before your
        tour; there is no penalty for rescheduling. Trip-specific policies may apply and certain tours or private
        charters may carry a rebooking feeâ€”please confirm details at the time of booking.
